# Fingerprint-based Blood Group Detection using CNN 

This project focuses on predicting a person’s **blood group using fingerprint images** with the help of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
It demonstrates the application of **deep learning in biometric and medical domains**.


##  Project Overview

Traditionally, blood group detection requires invasive medical tests.  
This project explores a **non-invasive, biometric-based approach** by analyzing fingerprint patterns and extracting meaningful features using CNNs to classify blood groups.

##  Objective

- To design a **CNN-based deep learning model**
- To analyze fingerprint images
- To accurately predict **blood group categories**
- To demonstrate an innovative application of AI in healthcare
